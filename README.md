NORB_4
======

Welcome to the repository for all NORB 4 board software.


Introduction
============

The NORB 4 board is part of the NORB float series project which requires a whole new type of PCB. The NORB 3 board being the most equipped, with temperature/humidity sensing equipment and a micro SD socket to log all the data. However, despite it's 0.8mm thickness, the NORB 3 board when fully equipped is far too heavy to pass for a float, where the target total payload weight is only 30 grams maximum.
