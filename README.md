NORB_4
======

Welcome to the repository for all NORB 4 board software.


Introduction
============

The NORB 4 board is part of the NORB float series project which requires a whole new type of PCB. The NORB 3 board being the most equipped, with temperature/humidity sensing equipment and a micro SD socket to log all the data. However, despite it's 0.8mm thickness, the NORB 3 board when fully equipped is far too heavy to pass for a float, where the target total payload weight is only 30 grams maximum.


Therefore, a board was needed that would be absolutely tiny and far more lightweight in comparison. It's small ceramic chip antenna being only a fraction of the size and weight, replaced the huge heavy Taoglas patch antenna on the NORB 3 board. Having no temperature/humidity sensor, but its very own SI446x based radio circuit, coupled with a super-efficient LTC3526 regulator, this board is without doubt the most power efficient module developed by NORB!
